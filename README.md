# Hello-pips
My senses are set to achievements not failure so anything I do I know I can't fail but suceed
All the time about I view myself making the best out of me making the people around me proud 
I love singing and reading all the time

Learning to codes is the least of my problems cause i know once i set my mind to it I CANT FAIL AND I WILL THE BEST OUT IF IT NO MATTER THE COST
